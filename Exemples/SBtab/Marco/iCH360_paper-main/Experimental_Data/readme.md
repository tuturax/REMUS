This folder contains various experimental data mapped to our model, as well as the code used to parse it:
1. Fluxomics data from [1] and [2]
2. Metabolomics data from [3]
3. Estimates of model enzyme counts (in copies/cell) and mass abundances (in g/gDW) estimated from proteomics data from [4] (see `../Enzyme_Constraints/enzyme_abundance_estimation`)
