RNDR1,RNDR2	RNDR1b,RNDR2b	RNDR1b,RNDR2b,GRXR	The Ribonucleoside diphospahte reductase can work both wirh thioredoxin and glutaredoxin system. We only keep the thioredoxin version as thioredoxin appears to be more expressed. The Glutaredoxin reductase is removed as there are no other reactions involving glutaredoxin	NA
NA	NA	RNTR1c2,RNTR2c2,FLDR2	The RNTR should work with formate as an electron donor and is is active under unaerobic conditions. We remove them together with the corresponding Flavodoxin reductase	https://ecocyc.org/gene?orgid=ECOLI&id=EG11417
NA	NA	ACOATA,KAS14	While FabH possesses some side transacylase activity (ACOATA), this is 200-fold less than its condensation activity (KAS15). Hence this is only a secondary fatty acid initiation route	https://ecocyc.org/gene?orgid=ECOLI&id=EG10277
VALTA	VPAMTr	VPAMTr	These are both routes to production of valine. We keep VALTA (ilvE) as its the last step in the canonical biosyenthesis route and it is significantly more expressed in proteomic datasets
SULabcpp	SO4t2pp	SO4t2pp	two different ways of uptaking sulfur. SULabcpp is an ATP-dependent ABC transporter while SO4t2pp (cysZ) is a proton symporter. Unclear which one is more physisologically relevant, but we choose the symporter as it's simpler
NA	NA	FA80ACPHi,FA100ACPHi,FA120ACPHi,FA140ACPHi,FA160ACPHi,ACPPAT180,APH180	These are reactions converting ACP-bound fatty acids to ACP-free	NA
NA	NA	AACPS9,AACPS8,AACPS7,AACPS1,AACPS3,AACPS6	These are reactions converting ACP-free fatty acids to ACP-bound
